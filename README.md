# Table and Chairs
Test procedural generation of meshes through a resizable table actor:

* The table is resizable via drag and drop action on any corner and in real-time.
* As the table grows and shrinks, the chairs change in number and adjust to fill the available space.
* Chairs keep a minimum distance between each other and the table.
