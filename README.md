# Table and Chairs
Test procedural mesh generation in Unreal Engine 4.25.4 .

Resizable table actor:
* The table is resizable via drag and drop action on any corner and in real-time.
* As the table grows and shrinks, the chairs change in number and adjust to fill the available space.
* Chairs keep a minimum distance between each other and the table.
